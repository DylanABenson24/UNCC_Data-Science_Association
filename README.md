## Content
### Spring 2024
- First meeting: Introductory overview on SQL, covering high level topics and a code walkthrough. We utilized this overview for a collaborative online game to dive deeper into these SQL topics, escaping SQL Island. ("SQL Walkthrough.pptx", "SQL Walkthrough.sql")
- Second meeting: March Madness Analytics- presented a step-by-step approach for generating models for predictions, and went over a code sample I generated in Python. This presentation also features sources for the 2023 and 2024 Kaggle Competitions. ("March Madness ADS.pptx", "March_Madness_Prediction_Sample.ipynb")
- Third meeting: Introductory overview of Streamlit- covered basic concepts and essential syntax necessary for getting started with web app development in Python using Streamlit. Content in this repository is accessible, including Python code for a basic Sample website utilizing Streamlit. ("ADS_ Streamlit Introduction.pptx", "StreamlitSample.py")
- UNCC Hackathon Workshop 2024: Introduced fundamentals in Python- covered basic concepts and essential syntax necessary for data manipulation, visualization, numerical computing, and machine learning. Slides are attached within this repository. ("ADS- Introduction to Data Science_ Python.pptx")
- Fourth Meeting: Introduction to RNNs, LSTMs, and Neural Networks- covered basic concepts and went over essential elements revolving around the foundations of Neural Networks and their functionality, applications, and role within deep learning as a whole. ("RNN’s, LSTM’s, and Neural Networks.pptx")
